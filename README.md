# Overview
Repo to use to brainstorm ideas for our project for GDA 2021. Not intended to have "perfect" style or anything.

## Specific Notes
* `scripts/add_school_gentrification.py` - meant to be run from inside the `scripts` directory (i.e. you should run `cd scripts/` then `python add_school_gentrification.py`). Produces the file `data/school_gentrification.gpkg`.
